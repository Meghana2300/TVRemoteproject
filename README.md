# TVRemoteproject
Intro:
This helps the user about java frameworks and java containers in the form of TV Remote.

Technologies:
This is developed using Java
Concepts of Java Threads.
Java Graphics.

Steps to follow:

 Creating a project on ECLIPSE
 1.create a class with a class_name.
 2.import all the packages required.
 3.on the bases of java create a frame using=>JFrame
 4.add no.of buttons you want using=>  JButton
 5.add button actions using => button_name.addActionListner
 6.Then ECLIPSE automatically calls for extends JPanel ,implements Runnable along with class_name.
 
 #clock (timer)button
 7. In our project we are have a button for time.
 8. Use "SimpleDateFormat formatter" to get a local time.
 9.Using graphics create a clock structure and color.
 10.to run the clock and successfull working of clock use patterns for hours,minutes and seconds.=>" formatter.applyPattern"
 11.use the math functions for working of clock between the hours hands,minute hand and the seconds hand to show the exact time.
 
 #game button(puzzle)
 12.  #icon has power to swap with neighbour icon
 13.create the class with class_name with extends JFrame  and implements ActionListener
 14.create a buttons and its actions 
 15.having 9 buttons with 9 icons and each icon have a image to complete the puzzle
## Main aim: with the help of sample picture arrange the puzzle gird.
 16.then successfully done with sloving the puzzle.
 17.this puzzle class adds to the game button in the main code.
 
 18.The Tv remote also contain buttons like volume up and volume down.
 19.channel forword and backword button.
 20.Tv on and off actions.
 
 21. At last it seems and works like our actual tv remote.
 
 Final Output:
 run the program 
 you will get the java container frame 
 and check the working of Tv remote.
